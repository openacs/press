<h3>II. Introduction</h3>

Most Web services and almost all corporate sites have a "foobar.com in
the news" page. This page typically offers a chronological list of
articles appearing in newspapers, magazines, etc., in which the site or
company is featured. This differs from our News application in that
the site publisher is linking off to other publications and not trying to
disseminate news himself. The Press application supports site-wide press
coverage - appropriate when one ACS installation is being used for a
company - and subcommunity press coverage, e.g. for a service like
<a href="http://arfdigita.org">arfdigita.org</a> where many
organizations are using the same ACS instantiation. Anyone
who has the administrator role in a user group can edit the press
coverage for that group. Press items are displayed using a paging
system. The module can be configured to display a set number of items
on the main page, and will offer links to 'previous' and 'next' pages
when these are available. The press administrator can revise a press item by
adding a new revision.  Because the application employs version
control, the administrator can switch back to a historic
version of a press item should the need arise.

<h3>III. Historical Considerations</h3>

The Press application was designed by looking at the presentation
formats appearing on sites like <a
href=http://www.scorecard.org>www.scorecard.org</a> and <a
href=http://www.valinux.com>www.valinux.com</a> and selecting those
features we felt were most desirable. Our initial design was later
modified to add pagination and access to an archive of expired
articles based on feedback from client sites.

<h3>IV. Competitive Analysis</h3>

The Press application is consistent with the functionality of similar systems on the public internet.

<h3>V.Design Tradeoffs</h3>

By employing an application-specific templating system for this
package, we offer site owners the benefit of simplified display
customization on a per article basis.  The templating system adds
additional complexity to the Press application, especially with
respect to displaying articles.  Here, we have sacrificed usability
for a more advanced feature set.  The use of templates will minimally
require the application administrators to learn and use HTML and to
employ variables used by this templating system. We have automated the
linking function of the press module in order to prevent the
administrator having to learn ADP-programming.

<h3>VI. Data Model Discussion</h3> The Press application makes heavy
use of the exisiting ACS Content Repository service and its API, but
not of its templating system. A press item consists of:
<ul>
<li>a row-entry in
the table cr_item, where all of the meta-information that isn't
already stored in acs_objects concerning these items is placed, </li>
<li>one or
several rows in the revision table cr_revisions, and</li>
<li>a custom table,
cr_press, which holds the remainder of the information necessary to
describe a press item.</li>
</ul>
The important template information is found in
the table press_templates.
<pre>
create  table cr_press (
    press_id                    integer
                                constraint cr_press_id_fk references cr_revisions
                                constraint cr_press_pk primary key,
    -- include package_id to provide support for multiple instances
    package_id                  integer,
    -- constraint cr_press_package_id_nn not null,                      
    -- information about the publication where this press item appeared
    -- *** The journal name, the journal URL ***
    publication_name            varchar2(100)
                                constraint cr_press_publication_name_nn not null,
    publication_link            varchar2(200),
    -- *** the specific journal issue ***
    publication_date            date not null,
    publication_date_desc       varchar2(10),
    -- *** the article link, pages ***
    article_link                varchar2(400),
    article_pages               varchar2(40),
    article_abstract_html_p     varchar2(1) 
                                    constraint cp_article_abstract_html_p_ck
                                    check (article_abstract_html_p in ('t','f')),
    -- *** support for dates when items are displayed or archived ***
    -- unapproved release dates are null
    release_date                date,
    -- unscheduled archiving dates are null
    archive_date                date,
    -- support for approval, if ApprovalRequiredP == 1
    approval_user               integer
                                constraint cr_press_approval_user_fk
                                references users,
    approval_date               date,
    approval_ip                 varchar2(50),
    -- *** presentation information ***
    -- supply own press-specific templates (see table below) until
    -- template system is better organized and documented
    template_id                 integer default 1 
                                constraint cr_press_templ_id references press_templates 
);
</pre>
Note that different package instances of 'press' can 
be distinguished by the column 'package_id' (and not 
by the inherited context_id in acs_objects).<ul>
<li>The items are assigned to the folder 'press' in the content repository. 
<li>The PL/SQL API provides procedures and functions to create, delete, 
approve, archive, query, release, etc. a press item. New revisions 
are added using the package press_revision. 
<li>A new revision generates an entry in cr_press and cr_revisions 
in parallel and updates the live_revision in cr_items. We opted 
to keep all press-specific information as well as release and 
approval information in the cr_press table such that each revision 
has its own auditing information. There is no UI to edit a 
revision; editing is accomplished by adding a new revision of the
press item in question.
</ul>

<h3>Templating</h3>
The module provides a flexible templating system to support the 
wide range of formats needed for different sites and types of 
press coverage. Templates can be defined for different journals 
and styles. They can be mixed on the same site. A press item 
contains the followings information:

<ul><li>publication_name 
    <li>publication_date 
    <li>article_title 
    <li>article_abstract 
    <li>article_pages
    <li>publication_date_desc
</ul>

<p>A press administrator can define named templates to control 
how these pieces of information are displayed. The templates 
are written as HTML fragments using the variables listed above, each
of which is flanked by '@' signs (see below).
These are the essential variables that must occur in 
any template. A sample template might be:</p>

<pre>
      &lt;b&gt;@publication_name@&lt;/b&gt; - @article_name@ (@article_pages@)
      &lt;dd&gt;(@publication_date@) - "@article_abstract@"
</pre>

<p>This template would be expanded into:

<blockquote>
      <dl><b>Dog's Life</b> - Planet of the Dogs (pp 50-52) 
      <dd>(January 1, 2100) - "They used to say that every dog has 
          his day. Little did humans know that the collapse of their 
          society at the beginning of this millenium would give 
          rise to a new golden age of canine rule." </dd></dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Hyperlinks to external publications and articles are inserted 
automatically and optionally tracked using the clickthrough 
module, currently under development in ACS4.

<h3>Permissions</h3>
With the ACS4 permissions model, the press administrator need 
no longer be identical to the site administrator. The application 
now has a hierarchical set of permissions which can be assigned 
to any party as needed. The press root privilege is 
<code>press_admin</code> which comprises <code>press_create, 
press_delete, press_approve,</code> and <code>press_read</code>.

<p>By default, <code>press_admin</code> inherits from the 
site-wide admin. The <code>press_read</code> permission is 
assigned to the public so that all users, including non-registered 
users, have access to /press/. Currently, the <code>press_create</code>
 permission is unassigned by default and left commented 
out of the data model. Uncommenting it would assign the 
privilege to create a press item to the context of 
<i>registered users</i>, if this is a desired policy. 
Approval of uploaded items, however, is still reserved 
to the <code>press_approve</code> permission which is 
exclusively possessed by <code>press_admin</code>. 
Changing those permissions in /permissions/ enables the 
site-wide admin to tailor a permission hierarchy to the 
needs of an individual site, e.g. sharing the <i>Press 
Administrator</i> duties among more individuals, or enabling 
certain persons to create press items. 

<h3>VII. Legal Transactions</h3>

<h4>User Pages</h4>
<ul>
<li>View press coverage.
<li>View archived press coverage.
</ul>
<h4>Press Administrator Pages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add new press coverage: press.new
<li>Edit existing press coverage: press_revision.new
<li>Archive existing press coverage: press.archive
<li>Make permanent existing press coverage: press.make_permanent
<li>Approve existing press coverage: press.approve('t')
<li>De-activate existing press coverage: press.approve('f')
<li>Delete existing press coverage: press.delete
<li>Create a new press template: insert a new row into press_templates
<li>Edit a press template: update a row in press_templates
<li>Delete a press template: delete a row in press_templates
</ul>

<h3>VIII. API</h3>

Much of the API is covered in the 
<a href="/doc/sql/display-sql?url=press-create.sql&package_key=press">
press-create.sql</a> file. The package body press and package body 
press_revision hold many of the most interesting PL/SQL 
functions and procedures:  
<ul>
<li>press.new: creates a new press item
<li>press.delete: deletes a press item
<li>press.make_permanent: removes archival date from items
<li>press.archive: archives items with a default date of now
<li>press.approve: approves submitted items for release (for use 
    when the general public can submit press items)
<li>press.approve_release: sets release_date and archive_date for item
<li>press.set_active_revision: sets one revision as the active revision
<li>press.is_live: determines if item has a live revision
<li>press.status: returns info as to permanent, when it will archive, 
    when it will be released
</ul>
Also of interest are the Tcl procedures which are largely wrappers 
for the PL/SQL functions and procedures and are located in the 
<a href="/api-doc/procs-file-view?path=packages/press/tcl/press-procs.tcl">
/tcl/press-procs.tcl</a> file:
<ul>
<li>press_items_archive: archives items at a certain date
<li>press_items_make_permanent: removes archival date from items
<li>press_items_delete: deletes press items
<li>press_check_date_order: ensures archive date is after release date
<li>press_coverage_samples: sets sample press variables
<li>press_format_item: puts press variables into template
</ul>

<h3>IX. User Interface</h3> Users have a limited set of pages
available to them. Administrator user pages are located in the
/press/admin directory. The <code>acs_privileges</code> of press,
along with the permissions on the <code>admin</code> directory,
determine which parts of the pages are visible to which user
types. Links for <b>administer</b> and <b>create press item</b> only
appear for those parties possessesing the appropriate privileges.
Users not authorized to view the index page - parties who were denied
the <code>press_read</code> permission - receive a not-too-unfriendly
<i>"You are not allowed to see this page"</i> message. The code looks
like:

<pre>
# Display unauthorize privilege page if user is anauthorized
if { ![ad_permission_p [ad_conn package_id] press_read] } {
    ad_returnredirect unauthorized
    return
}
</pre>

<h4>Press Administrator</h4>
The press gateway serves by default the <code>DisplayMax</code> 
number of press items or archived press items. The rest of the 
items can be viewed with a paging mechanism at the bottom of 
the page. The <code>archived items | live items</code> link 
appears, respectively, if such exist. Each item is rendered 
through its individual template, i.e. the index page can be 
heavily modified to match a site's appearance.

<p>For users with the <code>press_admin</code> privilege, two links
appear on the right side of the page, one to "administer" and one to
"create a press item". The other pages are restricted to the
press_admin, except the item-create** suite which is restricted to
<code>press_create</code>.

<p>The administer page shows a table of the active revisions of all
press items. The active revision need not coincide with the live
revision.  Press items can have the status of:

<ul>
  <li>approved and awaiting release 
  <li>approved and live
</ul>

Additionally, the archive status is shown if an item is approved. 
The archive status is either a fixed date in the future after 
the release date or null for permanently live items. 

<p>The administer page offers the option to archive, make 
permanent, or delete one or more items at once. 

<p>The one-item-admin page is accessed via links from the administer
page. Revision administration is handled via one-item-admin page.

<h3>X. Parameters</h3>

<p>The press application has three customizable parameters which 
must be set for each package instance.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>DaysUntilArchive</code></dt>
<dd>how many days after being released 
         until a press item goes into the archives</dd>
<dt><code>DisplayMax</code></dt>
<dd>how many items are shown on the index 
         page (for live and archived items)</dd>
<dt><code>ClickThroughP</code></dt>
<dd>whether or not Hyperlinks should go 
         through the click-through module</dd>
</dl>

<h3>XI. Acceptance Tests</h3>

You should test adding, viewing, editing, changing revisions, changing status and deleting a press item:

<ul>
<li>Go to /press/ and click on the Administer link.
<li>Add a press item
<li>Verify that the item shows up on the admin side and the user side with the correct number of days left for display.
<li>Add a new template to the system using the administer templates link from the Administer page.
<li>Revise your press item to use the new template
<li>Verify that the new revision is active, and that it is displayed on the user side.
<li>On the admin side, archive the item.
<li>Ensure that the user now sees it as an archived item.
<li>On the admin side, make the item permanent.
<li>Ensure that the user now sees it as a live item.
<li>Delete the item.
<li>Delete the template.
</ul>

<h3>XII. Future Improvements/Areas of Change</h3>
<ul>
<li>Definition of necessary tags in a file, and check for 
    those when new template is created
<li>Template check for inconsistent (e.g. an unclosed table) 
    HTML which can screw up entire page
<li>Hook into clickthrough module once that is completed 
    (currently there is only a mockup page, ct.tcl)
<li>Maybe a press privilege Request/Approval system between 
    the press_admin and users
</ul>
