<h4>I. Introduction</h4>

This document outlines the requirements for the ArsDigita Press application.<p>

<h4>II. Vision Statement</h4>

The Press application provides a way for websites to showcase and
archive articles in which the site has been featured or which have
subject matter of interest to the users of the website. This
application will provide a way to archive old press content, present
recent accomplishments, and have up-to-the-minute press items
available to the website users. Users coming to the site who are
unfamiliar with the company may thus be given an opportunity to see what the
public media has to say about the company while the company is given
the opportunity to selectively filter which press coverage is
presented to the user. Also, users are able to see press items which
have been submitted by community members and filtered by the website
administration.<p>

<h4>III. System/Application Overview</h4>

This application is based upon one main component: the content repository. This system organizes and stores all of the press articles and references. The system provides a simple templating system so that press items can be laid out based on a variety of source material default formats, e.g. newspaper articles, journal publications, on-line publications, or even company press releases.<p>
The Press module consists of three simple interfaces:
<ul>
<li>a site-wide administrator interface for creating and maintaining all press items
<li>a registered user group interface for creating and maintaining press items contained in that group
<li>a user interface for viewing a press item and leaving comments
</ul>

<h4>IV. Use-cases and User-scenarios</h4>

Press application users will largely fall into one of three user
groups: recipients, submitters, and administrators of press items.<p>

Press recipients will include, e.g., brokers researching the relative value
of the company for their clients, consumers interested in learning
more about a company before making a purchasing decision, suppliers
investigating the company's perceived order processing efficiency, and
so on. These people will have access not only to current media
coverage of the company's activities but also to a searchable archive
of such articles to better help them locate individual articles of
interest or show a more comprehensive picture of the company's public
side.<p>

Press submitters will include active members of the community who will
be adding the articles to the site. They will find information at
various locations, and bring them to the administrator's attention for
inclusion in the site.<p>

Press administrators will also be adding the articles to the
site. They will be the ones choosing which press items merit display,
deciding how many press items should appear on the company's homepage,
what the scope of the article's application should be, et cetera. The
press application supports group scoping which enables administrators
of individual groups to add press events for their group only. They
may also add public articles which may be seen by everyone.<p>

<b>Ginny Mae Group-Moderator</b> finds an interesting article on rope
toys for birds. She uploads it, using the Press interface, to the bird
section of the Pets community website. After previewing it, she
revises it once, then submits it for approval and publication by the
administrator.<p>

<b>Andie Admin</b> is the administrator of the Press module and either
receives an email alert or, if she has them disabled, simply remembers
to visit the site to approve articles the community has submitted. She
finds the article from Ginny Mae about rope toys. She edits it for
clarity (Ginny Mae has the tendency to ramble), and publishes it in
the Entertainment section of the Bird section of the Pets website.<p>

<b>Random Reader</b> frequents the Pets website, and he is in search
of something for his conure to do while Random is at work. He can't
afford the web browser setup (from research at MIT in the language
lab) that he reads about in the Entertainment area, however, the
article by Ginny Mae about rope toys that has just been added fits
right into his price range.<p>
